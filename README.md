## 💻 Technology Stack

### Core Framework
*   **[Next.js (v16 App Router)](https://nextjs.org/)**: The primary framework powering the platform, enabling server-side rendering (SSR), SEO optimization, file-based routing, and high-performance page delivery. It also includes built-in SEO utilities such as `sitemap.ts` and `robots.ts`.
*   **[React 19](https://react.dev/)**: Used to build dynamic, component-based user interfaces and interactive application logic.
*   **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: Provides strict typing, improved development tooling, and better maintainability for the codebase.

### Styling & UI Components
*   **[Tailwind CSS (v4)](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: A utility-first styling framework used to build responsive and scalable UI quickly.
*   **[Styled-Components](https://styled-components.com/)**: Used alongside Tailwind to implement component-scoped CSS-in-JS styling where dynamic styles are required.
*   **Iconography**: The platform integrates `react-icons` and `lucide-react` for scalable SVG icons across the UI.

### Animations & Interactions
*   **[Motion](https://motion.dev/)**: Used to create smooth page transitions, hover interactions, and UI animations.
*   **[GSAP](https://gsap.com/)**: Provides advanced animation timelines and high-performance DOM animations.
*   **[Lenis](https://lenis.darkroom.engineering/)**: Implements smooth scrolling across the platform for a more fluid user experience.

### Backend, State & Data Management
*   **[Supabase](https://supabase.com/)**: Acts as the primary backend service providing authentication, PostgreSQL database connectivity, and Row Level Security (RLS). Server-side authentication is handled using `@supabase/ssr`.
*   **[Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand)**: Used for global state management across the frontend, replacing heavier solutions like Redux.
*   **Data Fetching**: External APIs are handled using `axios`, alongside Next.js Server Actions for secure server-side operations.

## 🚀 Core Features & Architecture

### 1. Authentication Engine (`/auth` & `AuthProvider`)
*   Secure student login, registration, and session management powered by Supabase authentication.
*   A global `AuthProvider` wraps the React application to protect routes and supply user session data to APIs.

### 2. Modern Landing Page (`/app/page.tsx`)
A visually engaging, conversion-focused homepage built with modular components.
*   **`Hero.tsx`**: High-impact hero section featuring gradient headlines, trust indicators, and call-to-action buttons.
*   **`StatsStrip.tsx`**: Displays platform statistics and usage metrics.
*   **`infiniteCarousel` / `grid.tsx`**: Animated marquee sections showcasing university names (DU, JNU, SRCC) and feature grids.
*   **`Usp.tsx` & `CuetCoverage.tsx`**: Explain the platform’s core benefits and CUET syllabus coverage.
*   **`Review.tsx` & `faq.tsx`**: Student testimonials and collapsible FAQ components.

### 3. Mock Test Engine & Execution (`/mock-tests`, `/api/submit-test`)
The core functionality of the platform.
*   Dynamically loads mock tests using `lib/mock-tests.ts`.
*   Dedicated dynamic routes (`[test-id]`) render the exam interface.
*   A `ProceedLoader` component prepares students before entering the timed exam environment.
*   The `/api/submit-test` endpoint handles grading, analytics, and secure database storage.

### 4. Student Dashboard & Analytics (`/dashboard`, `/attempts`)
A protected dashboard where students can:
*   View previous test attempts
*   Analyze performance reports
*   Identify weak subjects and improvement areas.

### 5. Study Materials & Notices (`/materials`, `/notice`)
*   **`/materials`**: Repository for subject-wise notes, PDFs, and CUET preparation resources.
*   **`/notice`**: Announcement board for updates such as syllabus changes, new tests, or live sessions.

### 6. User Customization (`/profile`)
Allows students to manage:
*   Personal information
*   Account preferences
*   Credentials and settings.

### 7. Legal & Informational Pages (`/footer`)
Fully structured responsive pages including:
